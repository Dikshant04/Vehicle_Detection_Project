# Vehicle_Detection_Model_Project
This project focuses on estimating the speed of moving objects using computer vision techniques. By leveraging video data, the model can analyze the movement of objects across frames and calculate their speed in real-time. This can be applied in various domains, including traffic monitoring, sports analytics, and surveillance.
